 INTRODUCTION
------------
This project is designed to make life easier for people who 
use Microsoft Windows. In this application it will be possible 
to add text and keystrokes that you can activate via hotkeys 
in any application running on Microsoft Windows.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This application is tested on the following systems:
* Microsoft Windows XP
* Microsoft Windows 7

INSTALLATION
------------
You will find SimplyHotkeys-setup-v0.5.exe inside the "Installer" 
folder here on github(https://github.com/patchie/SimplyHotkeys).
The installer will automatically set SimplyHotkeys to startup 
with windows. You can change this feature inside the application.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
To configure hotkeys, double-click the icon in systemtray. 
You will then get access to a GUI (graphical user interface) 
that will explain what to do.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
You can troubleshoot the hotkeys database by opening and view 
or edit c:\hotkey.ini

FAQ
---
Q: How do i add keystrokes to my hotkey?
A: You can add for example {tab} or {enter}, to make it push 
   those buttons

TODO
----
* Make it save each time it looses focus
* Change from c:/ to %appdata% for saving .ini file, for privacy and security
* Make ctrl + 1 work in other applications like firefox or chrome while its disabled in the settings
* Change the rightclick systemtray menu
* Adding a better howto in the gui
* Adding "hotstrings" tab (http://ahkscript.org/docs/Hotstrings.htm)
* New screenshots
